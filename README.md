# TriviaGame

This game is a simple multiple choice trivia game. It prompts the player to hit start, at which point a sixty second timer begins to count down. After answers to the four questions are selected, submit sends the answers, and returns the number of correct, and the number of incorrect answers. The project is useful in exercising a coder's ability to deal with user choices, and how to check them against the correct answers. The biggest challenge here is so determine a method to do that and execute it without any bugs. Currently, the only obvious bug in the game is the counter, which doesn't fully clear when the game is refreshed. The game is also missing an automatic restart function (on a timer or via a button), and a method by which to clear values. The function for restartGame is defined, but not called at the end due to these bugs.
